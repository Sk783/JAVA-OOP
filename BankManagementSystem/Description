The Bank Management System is a Java-based software application designed to automate the management of banking operations in a financial institution. 
It provides a range of functionalities, including account management, transaction processing, and subclass implementation, to facilitate efficient
and secure banking activities.

Main Features:

1. Account Management: The system enables the creation and management of different types of accounts, such as savings accounts, checking accounts,
and fixed deposit accounts. Each account is associated with customer information, including name, address, and contact details. The Account class
serves as the parent class for various account types.

2. Deposit and Withdrawal: The Account class includes methods for depositing and withdrawing funds. The deposit method allows customers to add money
to their accounts, while the withdrawal method enables them to withdraw funds, subject to available balances and any associated rules or restrictions.

3. SavingAccount Subclass: The Bank Management System includes a subclass called SavingAccount that extends the Account class. The SavingAccount subclass 
incorporates specific features and behaviors relevant to savings accounts. It may include additional attributes such as interest rate, minimum balance 
requirements, and methods to calculate interest or enforce specific rules.

4. Transaction Processing: The system provides functionality to process various types of transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers.
These transactions are handled securely and accurately, ensuring proper balance updates and transaction history maintenance. The Transaction class may
contain methods for executing and recording transactions.
